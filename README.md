# Artistic Image Recommendation

Given an image, the model will output image recommendations based off of learned image similarity. Note that this code does not contain the parameters for the encoder or any saves for the model. This is only the source code. If you would like to use this, then you will need to train it on your own data.

## Encoder Training
Go to train_encoder.py.

Setup the configuration the how you would like.

## Model Building
Go to demo.ipynb.

Setup the configuration to how you would like. Then just run build_model.

## Dataset
The data set that I used to train the encoder and fit the model is from the link below.
